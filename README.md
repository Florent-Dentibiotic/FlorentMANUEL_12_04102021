<p>SportSee is an OpenClassRoom project. It's a startup dedicated to sports coaching witch wanted to renewal its user's dashboard.</p>

## Getting Started with SportSee

The new dashboard is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/).

### Prerequisites

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), I recommand [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_fr) if you are on MacOS and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) if you are on Windows.

You can also use :

-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). See [Yarn website for installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation

1 - To run it locally, you need to [install the back-end](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard), you just have to follow the instructions in the previous link.

2 - Download or fork this repository.

3 - Launch the back-end, it might use the port localhost:3000.

4 - `yarn start`ou `npm run start`, then `accept to run the app on another port` because 3000 is used by the back-end and open `http://localhost:3001`

5 - Enter `user12` ou `user18` in the form to access to one of the dashboards. You can try another another user to see the dashboard empty.

### Details

The application was developped with :

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/),
-   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com),
-   [D3.JS](https://d3js.org),
-   [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
